# calculator
Author: Keshav Raj 
I was just revising my developement and made this with love.
Some interesting things I used:-
1. Colour gradient for both background and calculator screen.
2. Hover characterstics for buttons.
3. Some basic tex alignments for a large number which u can scroll right left
4. And Of course my codeforces profile name in the footer( though I am a pupil right now but lets see till where I can reach).
So much thanks for visiting my github repo.
